        // * Starting from a blank HTML file, create an array with 10 question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows: 
        var questions = [
            { q: "Is the sky blue", a: "true" },
            { q: "Grass is green", a: "true" },
            { q: "we love covid", a: "false" }
        ]
        // * Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting OK (for true) or Cancel (for false).

        for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
            console.log(i);

            var answer = confirm(questions[i].q)
        }


// * Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.
